SI 579 001 WN 2021 Problem Set 1 - Creating and Deploying a Basic Page

This assignment will test the basics of creating HTML pages and deploying to GitHub.

First, create a page that meets all of the following requirements:

There must be at least 5 semantically meaningful elements
This includes elements like a header, article, footer, and h1-h6 tags
This does not include elements like html, body, span, or div
There must be an item that is at least four levels of nesting deep. For example, the "a" elements below would satisfy this requirement:
<header>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="./home.html">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="./contact.html">Contact</a></li>
         </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
Deploy your page to GitHub by creating a repository and make it public for everyone to view. You will be handing in a different link for every assignment, so you might want to name your assignment in a way thatâ€™s recognizable.
Be sure that your assignment is publicly viewable
Then, you must do at least one of the following:

Include CSS in your page
Include an image in your page
Get a free domain name from GitHub pages and deploy it do that domain name (you should be able to do this for free with "Student sign in" on GitHub)
Test your page with a screen reader, record it, and post the video to YouTube (if you do this one you need to upload the link to YouTube too)
Here are some ideas for your page:

A personal website that introduces yourself and contains information about yourself
An interactive resume or CV
A website about one of your interests
A website for an organization, club, or business
An example page that would get full credit: https://soney.github.io/si-579/hw1/
