    <h2>I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE :)
    </h2>
    <p width="50%">
        Hello! I am Ray Chang, a multidisciplinary UX designer who always seeking for solutions to real-word challenges. As the team coordinator, I always look for diversity in unity; As a communicator, I take the responsibility to speak out for those who are in need.
    </p>
    <p width="50%">
        Before I decide to be an UX professional, I spent 4 years studying Communication, which not only taught me how to persuade, but also helped me feel the power of empathy - to understand messages behind the words.
    </p width="50%">

        Ann Arbor's winter is kinda nice, so I plan to go outside (with my face mask on, of course) as much as I can with my friends - working from home has changed a lot of things, but it should not be the reason to make us lonely. I hope you have a safe and healthy winter too, and I am looking forward to see you in the coming spring!
